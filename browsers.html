      <h2>From Mosaic to Chrome</h2>
      <p>
        The first web browser was <em>WorldWideWeb.app</em>, created by Tim Berners-Lee. However, the first popular graphical browser was <strong>Mosaic</strong>, released in 1993 by Marc Andreessen and NCSA. Mosaic introduced the graphical user interface (GUI), allowing text and images to be viewed together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mosaic later evolved into <strong>Netscape Navigator</strong>, which became a dominant browser in the early 90s. Competition grew fierce when Microsoft launched <strong>Internet Explorer</strong> in 1995, bundled with Windows OS.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2004, <strong>Mozilla Firefox</strong> introduced tabbed browsing and enhanced security. In 2008, Google released <strong>Chrome</strong>, emphasizing speed, simplicity, and security. It soon became the most widely used browser. Other browsers such as Safari, Opera, and Microsoft Edge continue to serve niche and general audiences.
